# RepBiomrkr repository

"Representing fMRI data to isolate mental health biomarkers"

## To run this code locally:
Clone this repository (or download it) and use the notebooks `functional_alignment_example.ipynb` and `manifold_learning_example.ipynb`. They will import code from the python scripts and data from the `sample_data` directory. You can also create your own notebook and source these scripts yourself.

## To run these tutorials on colab: 
Fork the repository into your own github account, and navigate to your fork. Then, choose which notebook you want to work with first and open it in github:

Then, in the browser line, substitute 'github' with 'githubcolab'. This will open the notebook in Google Colab:

From here, you can create a copy of it in your Google Drive account by clicking `Copy to Drive` at the top, or not (if you save it, it will prompt to save the changes to your Github repository).

Then you will follow the instructions within the notebook to clone the repo into your colab session and access the data.
